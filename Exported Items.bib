	abstract = {Non-maximum suppression is an integral part of the object detection pipeline. First, it sorts all detection boxes on the basis of their scores. The detection box M with the maximum score is selected and all other detection boxes with a signiﬁcant overlap (using a pre-deﬁned threshold) with M are suppressed. This process is recursively applied on the remaining boxes. As per the design of the algorithm, if an object lies within the predeﬁned overlap threshold, it leads to a miss. To this end, we propose Soft-{NMS}, an algorithm which decays the detection scores of all other objects as a continuous function of their overlap with M. Hence, no object is eliminated in this process. Soft-{NMS} obtains consistent improvements for the coco-style {mAP} metric on standard datasets like {PASCAL} {VOC} 2007 (1.7\% for both {RFCN} and Faster-{RCNN}) and {MS}-{COCO} (1.3\% for R-{FCN} and 1.1\% for Faster-{RCNN}) by just changing the {NMS} algorithm without any additional hyper-parameters. Using Deformable-{RFCN}, Soft-{NMS} improves state-of-the-art in object detection from 39.8\% to 40.9\% with a single model. Further, the computational complexity of Soft-{NMS} is the same as traditional {NMS} and hence it can be efﬁciently implemented. Since Soft-{NMS} does not require any extra training and is simple to implement, it can be easily integrated into any object detection pipeline. Code for {SoftNMS} is publicly available on {GitHub} http://bit.ly/ 2nJLNMu.},
