	abstract = {While most approaches to semantic reasoning have focused on improving performance, in this paper we argue that computational times are very important in order to enable real time applications such as autonomous driving. Towards this goal, we present an approach to joint classiﬁcation, detection and semantic segmentation via a uniﬁed architecture where the encoder is shared amongst the three tasks. Our approach is very simple, can be trained end-toend and performs extremely well in the challenging {KITTI} dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art in the road segmentation task. Our approach is also very efﬁcient, allowing us to perform inference at more then 23 frames per second.},
