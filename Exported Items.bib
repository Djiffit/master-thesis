	abstract = {Feature pyramids are a basic component in recognition systems for detecting objects at different scales. But recent deep learning object detectors have avoided pyramid representations, in part because they are compute and memory intensive. In this paper, we exploit the inherent multi-scale, pyramidal hierarchy of deep convolutional networks to construct feature pyramids with marginal extra cost. A topdown architecture with lateral connections is developed for building high-level semantic feature maps at all scales. This architecture, called a Feature Pyramid Network ({FPN}), shows signiﬁcant improvement as a generic feature extractor in several applications. Using {FPN} in a basic Faster R-{CNN} system, our method achieves state-of-the-art singlemodel results on the {COCO} detection benchmark without bells and whistles, surpassing all existing single-model entries including those from the {COCO} 2016 challenge winners. In addition, our method can run at 6 {FPS} on a {GPU} and thus is a practical and accurate solution to multi-scale object detection. Code will be made publicly available.},
