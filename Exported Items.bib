	abstract = {Model efﬁciency has become increasingly important in computer vision. In this paper, we systematically study various neural network architecture design choices for object detection and propose several key optimizations to improve efﬁciency. First, we propose a weighted bi-directional feature pyramid network ({BiFPN}), which allows easy and fast multi-scale feature fusion; Second, we propose a compound scaling method that uniformly scales the resolution, depth, and width for all backbone, feature network, and box/class prediction networks at the same time. Based on these optimizations, we have developed a new family of object detectors, called {EfﬁcientDet}, which consistently achieve an order-of-magnitude better efﬁciency than prior art across a wide spectrum of resource constraints. In particular, without bells and whistles, our {EfﬁcientDet}-D7 achieves stateof-the-art 51.0 {mAP} on {COCO} dataset with 52M parameters and 326B {FLOPS}1, being 4x smaller and using 9.3x fewer {FLOPS} yet still more accurate (+0.3\% {mAP}) than the best previous detector.},
