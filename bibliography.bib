	abstract = {Weather conditions often disrupt the proper functioning of transportation systems. Present systems either deploy an array of sensors or use an in-vehicle camera to predict weather conditions. These solutions have resulted in incremental cost and limited scope. To ensure smooth operation of all transportation services in all-weather conditions, a reliable detection system is necessary to classify weather in wild. The challenges involved in solving this problem is that weather conditions are diverse in nature and there is an absence of discriminate features among various weather conditions. The existing works to solve this problem have been scene speciﬁc and have targeted classiﬁcation of two categories of weather. In this paper, we have created a new open source dataset consisting of images depicting three classes of weather i.e rain, snow and fog called RFS Dataset. A novel algorithm has also been proposed which has used super pixel delimiting masks as a form of data augmentation, leading to reasonable results with respect to ten Convolutional Neural Network architectures.},

	abstract = {Extracting information related to weather and visual conditions at a given time and space is indispensable for scene awareness, which strongly impacts our behaviours, from simply walking in a city to riding a bike, driving a car, or autonomous driveassistance. Despite the significance of this subject, it is still not been fully addressed by the machine intelligence relying on deep learning and computer vision to detect the multi-labels of weather and visual conditions with a unified method that can be easily used for practice. What has been achieved to-date is rather sectorial models that address limited number of labels that do not cover the wide spectrum of weather and visual conditions. Nonetheless, weather and visual conditions are often addressed individually. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to automatically extract this information from street-level images relying on deep learning and computer vision using a unified method without any pre-defined constraints in the processed images. A pipeline of four deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, so-called the WeatherNet, is trained, relying on residual learning using ResNet50 architecture, to extract various weather and visual conditions such as Dawn/dusk, day and night for time detection, and glare for lighting conditions, and clear, rainy, snowy, and foggy for weather conditions. The WeatherNet shows strong performance in extracting this information from user-defined images or video streams that can be used not limited to: autonomous vehicles and drive-assistance systems, tracking behaviours, safety-related research, or even for better understanding cities through images for policy-makers.},
