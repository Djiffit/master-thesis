\chapter{Figures and Tables}

\section{Figures}
Figure~\ref{fig:logo} gives an example how to add figures to the document. Remember always to cite the figure in the main text.

\begin{figure}[h!] 
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{HY-logo-ml.png}
\caption{University of Helsinki flame-logo for Faculty of Science.\label{fig:logo}}
\end{figure}

\section{Tables}

Table~\ref{table:results} gives an example how to report experimental results. Remember always to cite the table in the main text. 

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Experimental results.\label{table:results}}
\begin{tabular}{l||l c r} 
Experiment & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 
\hline \hline 
$A$ & 2.5 & 4.7 & -11 \\
$B$ & 8.0 & -3.7 & 12.6 \\
$A+B$ & 10.5 & 1.0 & 1.6 \\
\hline
%
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\chapter{Citations}

\section{Citations to literature}

References are listed in a separate .bib-file. In this case it is named \texttt{bibliography.bib} including the following content:
\begin{verbatim}
@article{einstein,
    author =       "Albert Einstein",
    title =        "{Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K{\"o}rper}. ({German})
        [{On} the electrodynamics of moving bodies]",
    journal =      "Annalen der Physik",
    volume =       "322",
    number =       "10",
    pages =        "891--921",
    year =         "1905",
    DOI =          "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/andp.19053221004"
}
 
@book{latexcompanion,
    author    = "Michel Goossens and Frank Mittelbach and Alexander Samarin",
    title     = "The \LaTeX\ Companion",
    year      = "1993",
    publisher = "Addison-Wesley",
    address   = "Reading, Massachusetts"
}
 
@misc{knuthwebsite,
    author    = "Donald Knuth",
    title     = "Knuth: Computers and Typesetting",
    url       = "http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/%7Eknuth/abcde.html"
}
1
\end{verbatim}

In the last reference url field the code \verb+%7E+ will translate into \verb+~+ once clicked in the final pdf.

References are created using command \texttt{\textbackslash cite\{einstein\}}, showing as \citep{einstein}. Other examples: \citep{latexcompanion,knuthwebsite}.

Citation style can be negotiated with the supervisor. See some options in \url{https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Bibtex_bibliography_styles}.

\section{Crossreferences}

Appendix~\ref{appendix:model} on page~\pageref{appendix:model} contains some additional material.

\chapter{From tex to pdf}

In Linux, run \texttt{pdflatex filename.tex} and \texttt{bibtex filename.tex} repeatedly until no more warnings are shown. This process can be automised using make-command.
 
\chapter{Conclusions\label{chapter:conclusions}}

It is good to conclude with a summary of findings. You can also use separate chapter for discussion and future work. These details you can negotiate with your supervisor.
