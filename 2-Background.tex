\chapter{Neural networks}
Background stuff 
\section{Fully Connected Networks}
When needed example of a transfer learning head?, when good/bad
\section{Convolutional Neural Networks}
Show some basic CNN things maybe and why needed over fully connected bois :) 
\subsection{Neural image processing}
How it different from classical features and how/why it works
\section{RNN}
Depending on what may be used
