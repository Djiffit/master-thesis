%% History:
%% May 2019 Tomi Männistö, Antti-Pekka Tuovinen proofreading; 30 vs. 40 cr theses, etc.
%% May 2019 Tomi Männistö changed from babelbib to bibtex; Abstract page (and other pages as well) reformatting.
%% January–May 2019 several issues fixed by Niko Mäkitalo; long fields in abstract
%% March 2018 template file extended by Lea Kutvonen to exploit HYthesisML.cls.
%% Feb2018 This template file for the use of HYgraduML.cls was  modified by Veli Mäkinen from HY_fysiikka_LuKtemplate.tex
%% authored by Roope Halonen ja Tomi Vainio in 2017.
%% Some text is also inherited from engl_malli.tex versions by Kutvonen, Erkiö, Mäkelä, Verkamo, Kurhila, and

%% STEP 3:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Write your abstract to be positioned here.
%% You can make several abstract pages (if you want it in different languages),
%% but you should also then redefine some of the above parameters in the proper
%% language as well, in between the abstract definitions.

\begin{otherlanguage}{english}
    \begin{abstract}
        Use this otherlanguage environment to write your abstract in another language if needed.

        Topics are classified according to the ACM Computing Classification System
        (CCS), see
        \url{https://www.acm.org/about-acm/class}:
        check command \verb+\classification{}+. A small set of paths (1--3) should be used, starting from any top nodes
        referred to bu the root term CCS leading to the leaf nodes. The elements
        in the path are separated by right arrow, and emphasis of each element individually can be indicated
        by the use of bold face for high importance or italics for intermediate
        level. The combination of individual boldface terms may give the reader
        additional insight.

%% STEP 4: Write the thesis.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Your actual text starts here. You shouldn't mess with the code above the line except
%% to change the parameters. Removing the abstract and ToC commands will mess up stuff.

%% You may wish to include material to avoid browsing the definitions
%% above. Command \include{file} includes the file of name file.tex.
%% As a side effect, subsequent inclusions may force a page break.
